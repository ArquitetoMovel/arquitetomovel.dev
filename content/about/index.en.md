As a Software Architect, I am driven by a deep passion for technology and the challenge of building solutions. My professional journey has been marked by immersion in ecosystems such as .NET, Golang, and Swift, where I dedicate myself to designing architectures that not only solve complex problems but also drive innovation and performance.

I believe that technology, when well-architected, is a powerful tool to transform the world.

## Technical Expertise

My experience covers various aspects of software development:

### Architecture and Design
- Microservices Architecture
- RESTful API Design
- Design Patterns and SOLID
- Distributed Architectures
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

### Development
- **.NET**: C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, OpenTelemetry
- **Golang**: APIs, Microservices, Observability with OpenTelemetry
- **Swift**: iOS Development, SwiftUI
- **Cloud**: OCI, Azure, Kubernetes
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, Docker, Terraform
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Prometheus
- **AI**: Integrating AI into applications, including LLMs and generative AI tools, how to be more productive with AI
