As a Software Architect, I am driven by a deep passion for technology and the challenge of building solutions. My professional journey has been marked by immersion in ecosystems such as .NET, Golang, and Swift, where I dedicate myself to designing architectures that not only solve complex problems but also drive innovation and performance.

I believe that technology, when well-architected, is a powerful tool to transform the world.

## Technical Expertise

My experience covers various aspects of software development:

### Architecture and Design
